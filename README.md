This is the source of Chrome Extension: Force Redraw IMG on HTML5 Canvas

This extension was something I wrote as a practice when I was a college student.  As of today, it would be surprising to me if Chrome does not handle simple image rendering efficiently, so chances are that this extension is simply useless.  The extension and this repository are kept alive just for reference.
